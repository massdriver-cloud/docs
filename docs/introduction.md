Massdriver is a visual internal developer platform (IDP) that enables engineers to deploy production-ready cloud infrastructure and applications in minutes.

**Features that Teams Love:**

* **Infrastructure-as-Diagrams**: Diagrams as the source of truth. Onboard team members faster with accurate representations of your cloud environment.
* **Anti-lockin**: Use the best tool for the job in each cloud with the same interface. All infrastructure and applications run in _your_ cloud account - walk away anytime without a migration process.
* **No black boxes**: Our bundles and design docs are all [open source.](https://github.com/massdriver-cloud)
* **Parity**: Each `project` is a _blueprint_ with adjustable scale per application environment, region, or tenant.
* **Secure & Compliant**: Each provisioning runs security benchmarks and compliance scanning.
* **Automated IAM Management**: No one enjoys managing IAM; Massdriver gives teams principal of least privilege by default.
* **Secrets Management**: Secrets are per-row encrypted at rest and dynamically injected into applications at runtime.
* **Deletion Protection Everywhere**: Integrated OPA rules stop accidental deletion of critical infrastructure.
* **Visual Comparison Engine**: Visually _diff_ environments, regions, and deployment history. No more clicking endlessly through a cloud dashboard or reading config files to find out why "it worked in staging."
* **Integrated Monitoring and Alerting**: Infrastructure ships with common sense metrics and thresholds that can be customized. Feel free to cancel PagerDuty - we'll wake you up for free!
* **Naming and tagging conventions**: All resources managed by Massdriver have a consistent naming and tagging convention. One less bikeshed to paint.
* **Fast-tracked compliance**: Correct infrastructure diagrams, activity logs, bundle source code access, resource manifests, and change/deployment history. Everything a compliance auditor desires in their extremely exciting life.

Massdriver includes 50+ infrastructure and application bundles designed by industry experts focusing on security and best practices with support for AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes (in cloud or on-prem).

Massdriver is an extendable platform. We don't want to be the black box that Platforms-as-a-Service offer. With Massdriver, teams can design private [bundles](/bundles) and [applications](/applications), or [request bundles](https://roadmap.massdriver.cloud) and we'll add it to our roadmap.

Massdriver integrates with any CI system and provides a unified infrastructure and application continuous deployment system.

We fully dogfood Massdriver, and all of [our bundles](https://github.com/orgs/massdriver-cloud/repositories?q=&type=all&language=terraform&sort=) are open-sourced.
