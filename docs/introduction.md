Massdriver is a visual internal developer platfrom (IDP) that enables engineers to deploy production-ready cloud infrastructure and applications in minutes, no DevOps unicorn required.

Our goal is to help teams fully realize the promise of DevOps and remove the silos of knowledge between engineering and operations teams.

The culture of DevOps has been long dead, and modern "DevOps" teams are waterfall development in agile clothing.

Below are a list of technical features, but by far the most important feature we offer is _anti-frustration_.

Software Engineers, confidentally self-serve infrastructure and application services without the tyranny of an op's team backlog

Operations Engineers, let software engineers self-serve with the confidence that your governance, guardrails, and audit logs are in place. Focus on work thats valuable to the business, not just configuring an S3 bucket or database for the 1000th time.

**Features you'll love:**

* Anti-lockin: Use the best tool for the job in each cloud with the same interface. All infrastructure and applications run in _your_ cloud account - walk away anytime without a migration process.
* No black boxes: Our bundles and design docs are all [open source.](#LINKTBD)
* Parity: Each `project` is a _blueprint_ with adjustable scale per application environment, region, or tenant.
* Security benchmark and compliance scanning
* Automated IAM management and secrets management for your applications
* Integrated OPA rules to avoid accidental deletion
* Visually diff environments and deployment history
* Integrated monitoring and alerting, cancel PagerDuty - we'll wake you up for free!
* Consistent naming and tagging conventions everywhere.
* Fast track compliance with diagrams, activity logs, bundle source code access, and change/deployment history

Massdriver includes 50+ infrastructure and application bundles designed by industry experts focusing on security and best-practices with support for AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes (in cloud or on-prem).

Massdriver is an extendable platform. We don't want to be the black box that most PaaS are today. Design your own [private bundles](#TBDLINK) and [applications](#TBDLINK) or [request bundles](#TBDLINK) and we'll add it to our roadmap.

Massdriver integrates with your CI system and provides an unified infrastructure and application continous deployment system.

We fully dogfood Massdriver,and all of [our bundles](#TBDLINK) are open sourced.
