# Versions

Massdriver uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) to manage bundle versions and deployments. This provides predictable versioning behavior and enables sophisticated release management workflows that automate infrastructure updates across your environments.

## Semantic Versioning

All bundle versions in Massdriver follow the semantic versioning specification `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR**: Incremented for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Incremented for backwards-compatible functionality additions  
- **PATCH**: Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Examples

```
1.0.0    # Initial release
1.0.1    # Patch release (bug fixes)
1.1.0    # Minor release (new features)
2.0.0    # Major release (breaking changes)
```

## Development Releases

Development releases allow you to test versions before they become official releases. They use the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-dev.TIMESTAMP`:

```
1.2.0-dev.20060102T150405Z    # Development release for 1.2.0
1.2.0                        # Final release
```

### Key Properties

- **Ordering**: Development releases are sorted **before** their corresponding release version
- **Testing**: Perfect for staging environments and pre-production testing
- **Timestamps**: Multiple development releases are ordered by timestamp (higher = newer)

### Rapid Infrastructure Testing

Development releases are a powerful means of rapidly testing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) changes against real cloud resources:

**Local Development + Real Infrastructure:**
- Develop bundle changes locally on your machine
- Publish development releases without affecting production bundles
- Deploy development releases to real cloud environments for comprehensive testing

**Opt-in Testing Network:**
- Set up multiple packages using release channels with "Enable Development Releases" toggle
- These packages automatically pick up your latest development releases and run the full deploy/apply pipeline
- Run Terraform plans and compliance scans against actual provisioned resources
- Validate infrastructure changes with real cloud provider APIs

**Practical Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Make IaC changes locally
vim src/main.tf

# 2. Publish development release for testing
mass bundle publish --development

# 3. Visit the output URL to monitor all test infrastructure
# 4. Watch plan/apply/compliance pipelines execute automatically
# 5. Review Terraform plans and compliance results from real infrastructure
# 6. Iterate with new development releases or publish final release
```

This approach lets you stand up multiple real-world examples of your infrastructure changes before committing to a final release, ensuring your bundles work correctly across different cloud environments and configurations.

## Release Channels

Release channels use tilde (`~`) constraints to specify compatible version ranges. When a package uses a release channel, it **automatically runs the full deploy/apply pipeline** whenever a new version matching that channel is published. This includes compliance checks, Terraform plans, and all other validation steps. This automates infrastructure version management.

### Major Channel (`~1`)
Matches the latest version within major version 1:
- `~1` could resolve to `1.5.3` (latest in major 1)
- Will **not** upgrade to `2.0.0`
- Automatically deploys when new minor or patch versions are published (e.g., `1.6.0`, `1.5.4`)

### Minor Channel (`~1.1`)  
Matches the latest patch within minor version 1.1:
- `~1.1` could resolve to `1.1.7` (latest patch in 1.1.x)
- Will **not** upgrade to `1.2.0`
- Automatically deploys when new patch versions are published (e.g., `1.1.8`)

### Latest Channel (`latest`)
Matches the newest stable release:
- Will return the highest semver version, not "most recent"
- Will upgrade to any newer *stable* version
- Automatically deploys when any new stable version is published

### Release Strategies

**Stable (Default):**
- Only receives stable releases
- Excludes development releases
- Recommended for production environments

**Development Release:**
- Receives both stable and development releases
- Automatically includes development releases when using release channels
- Recommended for testing and staging environments

## Development Releases and **Real Infrastructure** Testing

Development releases let you test infrastructure changes against **actual cloud resources** before promoting a version to release. Publishing a development release outputs a monitoring URL for every package configured to test it. These packages automatically deploy the development release and run their full validation pipeline—Terraform plans, compliance checks, and deployments—against live cloud APIs.

This process validates infrastructure changes across multiple environments and configurations simultaneously, revealing issues like API drift, quota limits, and provider-specific behaviors that static analysis tools can't catch.

## Automated Version Distribution with Release Channels

Release channels automate version distribution across environments. Instead of updating every package manually, you publish once, and packages automatically upgrade based on their configured version constraints.

For example, a package on channel `~2.5` will automatically deploy any patch release (`2.5.1`, `2.5.2`, etc.), while staging or dev environments may use wider channels for faster updates. This keeps environments current within defined boundaries and ensures security patches flow automatically—without coordination or manual promotion steps.

## Version Management in Massdriver

### Bundle Development and Publishing

#### Setting Bundle Version

In your `massdriver.yaml`, you now specify a `version` field:

```yaml
schema: draft-07
name: aws-rds-postgres
description: "PostgreSQL database on AWS RDS"
version: "1.2.3"  # Must be valid semantic version
```

**Version Rules:**
- **Required Format**: Must be `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)
- **Default Fallback**: If omitted, defaults to `0.0.0` (for backwards compatibility)
- **Immutable Releases**: All versions are immutable once published, **except `0.0.0`**
  - Version `0.0.0` can be republished multiple times
  - This allows teams to iterate and work through an initial release without version management overhead
  - Once you publish any other version (e.g., `0.0.1` or `1.0.0`), it becomes immutable

#### Publishing Options

**Standard Release:**
```bash
mass bundle publish
```
- Publishes the exact version from `massdriver.yaml`
- Creates an immutable release
- Available immediately for use by your end users

**Development Release:**
```bash
mass bundle publish --development
# or
mass bundle publish -d
```
- Adds `-dev.TIMESTAMP` to your base version (e.g., `1.2.3-dev.20060102T150405Z`)
- Base version (`1.2.3`) must not have been published yet
- Allows testing before the final release
- Perfect for feature branches and testing workflows
- **Outputs a URL** to view all test infrastructure using this development release
  - See plan/apply/compliance pipelines executing in real-time
  - Monitor all packages configured to test this development release

### Package Version Management

#### Version Selection Interface

![Package version configuration panel](img/package-version-configuration.png)

In the package configuration panel, developers can set the version constraint:

**Published Versions (Strict SemVer):**
- `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, `1.1.5`, `2.0.0` (exact published versions only)
- Not free-form - must select from published versions
- Development releases are **hidden** from this interface

**Generated Release Channels:**
- `~1`, `~1.1`, `~2`, `~2.1` (auto-generated tilde patterns for each possible)
- `latest` - Newest SemVer release
- When you set a version constraint, `currentVersion` gets updated to show what will deploy

#### Version Constraints

**Upgrade-Only Policy:**
- ✅ Can upgrade: `1.0.0` → `1.1.0` → `2.0.0`
- ❌ Cannot downgrade: `2.0.0` → `1.1.0`
- ✅ Can rollback: Restore previous configuration with its original version

**Configuration Snapshots:**
Each version change creates a configuration snapshot, enabling safe rollbacks to previous states while maintaining the upgrade-only constraint for new deployments.

## Upgrade Strategies

### Feature Upgrades  
Use minor channels for patch updates:
```
~1.1    # Patch updates only (1.1.0 → 1.1.5)
```

### Major Upgrades
Use major channels for latest features:
```
~1      # All updates within major 1 (1.0.0 → 1.9.5)
```

## Best Practices

### For Bundle Developers

1. **Set Explicit Versions**: Always specify `version` in `massdriver.yaml`
   ```yaml
   version: "1.2.3"  # Explicit semantic version
   ```

2. **Development Workflow**: Use development releases for testing
   ```bash
   # Set version in massdriver.yaml
   version: "1.5.0"
   
   # Publish development release for testing
   mass bundle publish --development  # Creates 1.5.0-dev.timestamp
   # Outputs URL to view all test infrastructure and pipeline executions
   
   # Monitor plan/apply/compliance pipelines in real-time
   
   # Publish final release
   mass bundle publish  # Creates 1.5.0
   ```

3. **Follow SemVer Guidelines**:
   - **Patch** (`1.0.1`): Bug fixes, security updates, documentation
   - **Minor** (`1.1.0`): New optional features, additional cloud regions
   - **Major** (`2.0.0`): Breaking changes, removed parameters, incompatible updates

4. **Version Progression**: Ensure each version is greater than the previous
   - ✅ `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` → `1.1.0` → `2.0.0`
   - ❌ Don't skip versions unnecessarily

## Version Lifecycle

    J -->|Exact| K[Pin to 1.2.0]
    J -->|Channel| L[Use ~1.2]
    J -->|Strategy| M[Stable/Development Release]
```

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Version Definition**: Set semantic version in `massdriver.yaml`
2. **Development Release**: Optional development release publishing for testing (`-d` flag)
3. **Testing Phase**: Validate development releases in staging environments
4. **Stable Release**: Publish final immutable version
5. **Package Selection**: Choose version strategy in UI dropdown
6. **Deployment**: Package runs with selected version/automation rule

## Version Fields and Properties

Each package in Massdriver has several version-related fields that control how it behaves:

### Package Version Fields

- **`version`** - The version constraint (e.g., `"1.2.3"`, `"~1.2"`, `"latest"`)
- **`currentVersion`** - The resolved semantic version that will be deployed next
- **`deployedVersion`** - The version that was last successfully deployed to infrastructure
- **`availableUpgrade`** - The newest version available for upgrade based on the constraint
- **`releaseStrategy`** - Whether the package receives stable releases only or also development releases
