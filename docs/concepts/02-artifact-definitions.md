Artifact definitions are types in Massdriver that determine:

* _which_ [artifacts](/concepts/artifacts) a bundle produces
* _what_ infrastructure or application dependencies a bundle has

They typically carry metadata like region, policies, authentication, and cloud resource identifiers. They act as a contract to describe [artifacts](/concepts/artifacts) used between bundles.
