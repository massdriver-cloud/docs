A collection of [manifests](#manifest) that compose an application or architecture. A project acts as a 'blue print' that can be applied to multiple [targets](#target) (e.g.: environments or regions).

A project also acts as the parity boundary. All targets in a project will have the same blueprint of resources applied (although scale can be controlled independently).
