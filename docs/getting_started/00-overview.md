Welcome to Massdriver! This getting started guide will walk you through the essential workflows and features of our platform. By the end of this series, you'll be comfortable with the core concepts and ready to start building your own infrastructure.

## What is Massdriver?

Massdriver is a comprehensive platform for managing cloud infrastructure through reusable, composable bundles. Our platform combines the power of infrastructure-as-code with visual design tools, making it easy to build, deploy, and manage complex cloud architectures.

## What You'll Learn

This getting started guide is organized into several focused sections:

1. **[Deploying Your First Bundle](01-deploying-first-bundle.md)** - Get hands-on experience with the core Massdriver workflow by publishing and deploying a simple bundle
2. **[Connecting Bundles With Artifacts](02-connecting-bundles.md)** - Learn how connect bundles together and share information between them using artifacts and connections.

Each guide builds upon the previous one, giving you a comprehensive understanding of how to work with Massdriver effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
- A **free** Massdriver account - [Create one here](https://app.massdriver.cloud/register)
