# Sync Templates From Source

Templates are boilerplate for extending the Massdriver platform with private infrastructure and applications. The boilerplates can be started with `mass bundle new` which will begin a questionnaire
and interpolate your values in to the boilerplate. From there you can customize the IaC in the src directory or UI in the massdriver.yaml file.
