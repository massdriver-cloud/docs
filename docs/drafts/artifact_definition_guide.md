Our goal is to help teams fully realize the promise of DevOps and remove the silos of knowledge between engineering and operations teams.

The culture of DevOps has been long dead, and modern "DevOps" teams are waterfall development in agile clothing.

Operations Engineers, let software engineers self-serve with the confidence that your governance, guardrails, and audit logs are in place. Focus on work thats valuable to the business, not just configuring an S3 bucket or database for the 1000th time.
