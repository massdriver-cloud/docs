# Migrating or Upgrading PostgreSQL with Minimal Downtime

This runbook can be used for:

* Performing major version upgrades of PostgreSQL 12+ with minimal downtime
* Performing cloud migrations of PostgreSQL 12+ with minimal downtime between services like Heroku PostgreSQL to AWS RDS.

:::note
This tutorial assumes both PostgreSQL databases are in the same network. 

If they are not you'll need to set up a VPN tunnel between your networks during your migration.

A great option is [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install/). We'll be posting a tunneling runbook soon!

This runbook is based on this [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd0WlFls9b8). 

There is an accompanying [tutorial](https://github.com/massdriver-cloud/webinar-postgresql-logical-replication) that runs in docker compose that can be used for practice.


## Upgrading / Migrating Postgres with Logical Replication

PostgreSQL logical replication is a data synchronization method that enables the replication of individual database changes (such as inserts, updates, and deletes) in a fine-grained manner between two PostgreSQL databases. It uses a publish-subscribe model, allowing changes from a source database's specified tables to be captured, transformed into a logical representation, and then applied to target databases.

With logical replication there are two options for getting your existing data into the destination database:

* Using `copy_data = true` with the replication subscription
* Using `copy_data = false` and performing pg_dump/pg_restore

This tutorial will use the `copy_data = false` option and a pg_dump/pg_restore as it is more efficient for large databases.

This is the recommended approach for large data sets especially migrating or upgrading across networks. It can be time and resource consuming to replicate 100GB between something like Heroku and AWS RDS. This requires additional steps and brief downtime to prepare.

Pros:
* Controlled Replication: You have control over when the replication process occurs. This can help you manage the impact on server resources.
* Reduced Network Traffic: As replication is not continuous, there's less ongoing network traffic compared to real-time replication.

Cons:
* Complexity: Manual dump and restore processes involve more steps and potential for errors, especially with large datasets.
* Data Lag: Data replication is not immediate, resulting in data lag between the source and target databases.

:::tip
If you have a small database we suggest dump/restore if you can tolerate downtime, otherwise for small databases that *cannot* tolerate downtime the [tutorial](https://github.com/massdriver-cloud/webinar-postgresql-logical-replication) has a walkthrough of `copy_data = true`.
:::

To perform logical replication we'll need to make sure the WAL level (`wal_level`) is set to `logical`.

The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) in PostgreSQL is a transaction log that records changes to the database in a sequential manner. 

It serves as a reliable mechanism to ensure data durability, high availability, and crash recovery by allowing the replay of logged changes to reconstruct the database to a consistent state in the event of system failures.

Ensure that your WAL level is set to `logical` and that you have ample replication slots. **10** is a great setting for many upgrades/migrations.

```conf title="postgresql.conf"
wal_level = logical
max_replication_slots = 10
```

This whole upgrade/migration process is a few step that takes a matter of minutes **not including your dump/restore time**.

### 1. Put your application in Maintenance Mode

**This step will depend on how you manage maintenance mode in your application.**

To get started put your application into maintenance mode. This will be the first and longest of two downtimes (the latter will be brief as your application restarts w/ a new database connection string).

Its important to stop the application from receiving new requests because we don't want records written between the time the database dump is taken and the replication slot is created.

### 2. Use pg\_dump to make a backup of your _old database_

Connect to your _old database_ and run pg_dump:

```shell title="Dump old database"
pg_dump -U YOUR_USER -F t YOUR_DATABASE > YOUR_DATABASE-dump.tar
```

### 3. Create publication & replication slot on your _old database_

```shell title="Connect to psql on your old database"
psql -U YOUR_USER -d YOUR_DATABASE
```

```sql title="Create publication on your old database"
CREATE PUBLICATION pub_pg_AN_IDENTIFIER_FOR_YOUR_MIGRATION_migration FOR ALL TABLES;
```

`FOR ALL TABLES` will publish changes for all tables, you can also set specific tables for replication.

```sql title="Create replication slot on your old database"
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('sub_pg_AN_IDENTIFIER_FOR_YOUR_MIGRATION_migration', 'pgoutput');
```

`pgoutput` is an output format for the pub/sub mechanism.


### 4. Bring your application out of maintenance mode.

**This step will depend on how you manage maintenance mode in your application.**

This is the end your first and longest downtime. Records will still be written to your _old database_, but also queued to be published to your replication slot.

### 5. pg\_restore to your _new database_

Above we dumped our database to `YOUR_DATABASE-dump.tar`. This will need

```shell title="Restore dump to your new database"
pg_restore -d YOUR_DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE-dump.tar --no-owner --role=YOUR_ROLE -C -U YOUR_ROLE;
```

### 6. Create a paused subscription on your _new database_


```shell title="Connect to psql on your new database"
psql -U YOUR_ROLE -d YOUR_DATABASE;
```

```sql title="Create a replication subscription from your new database"
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub_pg_AN_IDENTIFIER_FOR_YOUR_MIGRATION_migration 
  CONNECTION 'dbname=YOUR_OLD_DATABASE host=YOUR_OLD_HOST user=YOUR_OLD_ROLE password=YOUR_OLD_PASSWORD' 
  PUBLICATION pub_pg_AN_IDENTIFIER_FOR_YOUR_MIGRATION_migration WITH (copy_data = false, create_slot=false, enabled=true, slot_name=sub_pg_AN_IDENTIFIER_FOR_YOUR_MIGRATION_migration);
```

A few notes on the `WITH` options here:

* `copy_data` - tells the subscription not to copy all existing data, this can take a very long time across networks
* `create_slot` - will disable auto creation of the replication slot. We created it ahead in advanced.
* `enabled` - enable the subscription to immediately start getting new records
* `slot_name` - the replication slot to use

### 7. Check replication status between databases

You should now be able to run queries on your _old database_  and _new database_. Results may be different as replication catches up.

You can estimate the replication time by getting a few **log sequence numbers** (LSN) from both databases:

Connect to your _old database_ through `psql` and run the following to get the current WAL LSN:

```sql title="Get current WAL LSN from old database"
select pg_current_wal_lsn();
```

You'll get a result similar to:

```
pg_current_wal_lsn
--------------------
0/25A97D0
```

Connect to your _new database_ through `psql` and run the following to get the most recently received LSN:

```sql title="Get most recent LSN from new database"
select * from  pg_stat_subscription;
```

You'll get a result similar to:

```
-[ RECORD 1 ]---------+------------------------------
subid                 | 26874
subname               | sub_pg_AN_IDENTIFIER_FOR_YOUR_MIGRATION_migration
pid                   | 1781
relid                 |
received_lsn          | 0/25A97D0 <-- Last LSN received
last_msg_send_time    | 2023-08-09 04:10:25.602431+00
last_msg_receipt_time | 2023-08-09 04:10:25.602842+00
latest_end_lsn        | 0/25A97D0 <-- Last LSN reported back to publisher
latest_end_time       | 2023-08-09 04:10:25.602431+00
```

If these values are the same, you are in sync!

They are likely _not_ the same in a high scale system, so you can perform some basic math to see how far apart they are and get an estimate of when you should start database promotion.

```sql title="Replication lag in bytes"
-- OLD_DATABASE_CURRENT_WAL_LSN - NEW_DATABASE_RECEIVED_LSN
select '0/25A97D0'::pg_lsn - '0/25A97D0'::pg_lsn size_bytes;
```

This number should continue to go down, and based on the speed at which it does can give you an idea of how close to in sync your databases are.

### 8. Promote new database and cutover your application to the new database

The promotion process will introduce your next downtime. You'll want as minimal replication lag as possible.

The promotion process is pretty straightforward:

1. Put any applications that write to your source database in maintenance mode. This will be your second, brief **downtime**.
2. Check the replication and subscription status and drop the subscription
3. Copy sequence data from the source to destination database
4. Change the applications database connection info to the new database
5. Bring your application back up

First, let's put the application in maintenance mode (**DOWNTIME BEGINS**)

Check the current WAL LSN on your _old database_:

```sql title="Get current WAL LSN from old database"
select pg_current_wal_lsn();
```

You'll get a result similar to:

```
pg_current_wal_lsn
--------------------
0/25A97D0
```

Check that the last LSN acknowledged matches on your _new database_:

```sql title="Get the latest LSN reported from by new database"
select latest_end_lsn from pg_stat_subscription where subname = 'sub_pg_AN_IDENTIFIER_FOR_YOUR_MIGRATION_migration';
-- -[ RECORD 1 ]--+----------
-- latest_end_lsn | 0/25A97D0
```

Since traffic is stopped on your applications and no records are being written, this number should continue to decrease. Once they match, you can cut over.

Again, to check the number of bytes remaining:

```sql title="Replication lag in bytes"
-- OLD_DATABASE_CURRENT_WAL_LSN - NEW_DATABASE_RECEIVED_LSN
select '0/25A97D0'::pg_lsn - '0/25A97D0'::pg_lsn size_bytes;
```

Once the two values match you can drop the SUBSCRIPTION on your **new database**:

```sql title="Drop subscription from new database"
DROP SUBSCRIPTION sub_pg_AN_IDENTIFIER_FOR_YOUR_MIGRATION_migration;
```

:::caution
**Important!** Now you'll need to sync the sequence data between your _old database_ and _new database_. 

Sequences in PostgreSQL are database objects that provide a way to generate unique numeric values, often used for auto-incrementing primary keys in tables. 

Sequences **are not** replicated with logical replication. Skipping this step will result potentially conflicting primary key values for auto incrementing keys.
:::

Run the following command on both databases to see the differnces in sequence data:

```sql title="Display sequence data on both databases"
SELECT sequencename, last_value
FROM pg_sequences
ORDER BY last_value DESC NULLS LAST, sequencename;
```

Run the following command to dump your sequence data from your _old database_:

```shell title="Dump old database sequence data"
psql -h OLD_DB_HOST -U OLD_DB_USER -XAtqc 'SELECT $$select setval($$ || quote_literal(sequencename) || $$, $$ || last_value || $$); $$ AS sql FROM pg_sequences' OLD_DB_NAME > sequences.sql
```

```shell title="Restore sequence data to new database"
cat sequences.sql | psql -h NEW_DB_HOST -U NEW_DB_USER NEW_DB_NAME
```

:::note
If your application has materialized views, those will need to be manually refreshed as they are not automatically refreshed.
:::

Its time to point the application at the upgraded database.

Change your application's connection on your diagram if using Massdriver or updated your connection string if you are not and bring your application back online.

🎉 Congratulations, you're done!
