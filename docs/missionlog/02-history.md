Our bundle deployment diffing tool allows you to see the changes made to your bundle over time. This is useful for auditing changes made to your bundle, and for debugging issues. To view the diff tool in action, make a subtle change to your application by clicking **Configure** and changing a value to something else. Then, click **Deploy** to deploy the change. After the change is deployed, click **History** to view the deployment history. To diff deployments, click on the diff button **+/-** and select deployments to compare.
